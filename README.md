Originally started out as a storage repository to store all of the solutions for challenges on [Codeforce](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC), but have turned into storing other relevant challenges such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) as well.

Additionally, this repo is used to store code snippets for various concepts and operations that are commonly used, as well as documenting resources that can help to improve the programming skills.

## Programming Language

The main language that are used in the challenges is C++, other languages such as Rust and Go will be featured from time to time.

## Compilation

### New

Just copy the entire content for the solution into any executable `.cpp` source file and run.

### Legacy

Include the relevant files in main.cpp and run

```sh
g++ attempts/4A/solution4A.cpp main.cpp -o main.out && main.out
```
